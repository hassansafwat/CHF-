# Time Series Analysis 

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for performing stock market analysis using time series forecasting techniques. The analysis is focused on predicting stock prices for multiple companies using linear regression Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architecture.

## Description 
-Dataset:
You are provided with a CSV file named `stock_data.csv`, containing historical stock data.
The dataset has the following columns:
-  Date: The date of the data point
- Open: The opening price of the stock
- High: The highest price of the stock during the day
- Low: The lowest price of the stock during the day
- Close: The closing price of the stock

## Tec  Methods
Using  Python and any relevant libraries for data analysis and machine learning 

- Performing EDA analysis 
- Data preprocessing
- Model selection and training
- Evaluation of the trained model
